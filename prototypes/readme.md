## MIRO image
the layout in the digital prototype is the layout that can show data in the most organized way.
the first layout (index) should be simple and should contain most field names in one screen in alphabetical order so user can find it easily.
the second layout (field) should show all the data in table format neatly to make users understand what is the contents. however, the fact that due to the limitation fo the django database that some data should be consisted with the number format index, I should have added a collapsing table that users can refer when reading the table.
